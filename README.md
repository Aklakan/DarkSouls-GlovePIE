# GlovePIE Script for making the PC version of Dark Souls playable with Wiimote + Nunchuck

# Features

* All actions accessible!
* Intuitive mapping, e.g. control walk/run with nunchuck, block with (B), swing wiimote for attacks... - See remarks in the file for more details.


# How to use
* Pair your Wiimote via Bluetooth with your system. Google is your friend in case you run into issues. Note that in my case, under Windows 8, the Wiimote's 4 LEDs keep flashing after pairing. On the same notebook under Ubuntu only the first LED remains active. Despite the differences, on both platforms I was able to use the Wiimote using Wiican/GlovePIE.
* Download, Extract and run GlovePIE. Obtain it e.g. from [Heise](http://www.heise.de/download/glovepie-1140061.html)
* Open the Dark Souls GlovePIE script of this repo in GlovePIE
* Click run. If your Wiimote was successfully paired, it should after a few seconds only have the first LED lighting. If all LEDS are out, you may try pressing 1+2 to put it in bluetooth discovery mode.
* Have fun and adept to your needs
